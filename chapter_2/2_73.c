/*
 * Write code for function with the following prototype:
 * 
 * // Addition that saturates to TMin ot TMax 
 * int saturating_add(int x, int y);
 *
 * Instead of overflowing the way normal two's-complement addition does, sat-
 * urating addition returns `TMax` when there would be positive overflow, and TMin
 * when there would be negative overflow. Saturating arithmetic is commanly used 
 * in programs that perform digital signal processing.
 * 
 * Your function should follow the bit--level integer coding rules (page 120).
